This vignette discusses how to conduct a large variety of recurrence-based time series analyses using R-package *casnet*. It is not the only `R` package that can run recurrence analyses, the closest alternative in `R` to `casnet` is probably package [`crqa`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crqa/index.html). It has a great tutorial paper by [@coco2014]). Several other packages have dedicated functions, e.g. package `nonlinearTseries` has a function `RQA`. There are also many options outside of the `R` framework, see the [Recurrence Plot webpage](http://www.recurrence-plot.tk/programmes.php) for a comprehensive list of software.

There are 3 ways to run Recurrence Quantification Analyses in `casnet`:

* Using functions `rp`, `rp_measures` and `rp_plot`. These functions use a thresholded distance matrix known as a recurrence plot to calculate RQA measures. Use these functions if your time series length is around `2000` data points or less.
* Using function `rqa_par`, which does not construct a distance matrix, but processes matrix diagonals in parallel. The function is very fast and can handle very large time series.
* Using function `rqa_cl` which will run Norbert Marwan's [commandline Recurrence Plots](http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php). You can run this if your OS allows execution of 32 bit command line executable.

The following examples will demonstrate the basic use of the native `casnet` functions based on the `rqa_par` and `rp` families of functions, see the paragraph [An R interface to Marwan's commandline recurrence plots](#marwan) to learn about using `rqa_cl()` and [An R interface to Marwan's commandline recurrence plots](#marwan).

To learn more about the different types of Recurrence Quantification Analysis that can be conducted in `casnet` please see the chapters on RQA in the Complex Systems Approach book for more details: 

* [RQA on unordered categorical data](https://complexity-methods.github.io/book/unordered-categorical-data.html)

* [RQA on continuous data](https://complexity-methods.github.io/book/lvSystem.html)



# RQA based on a matrix: `rp()`



## Unordered categorical data

```{r}
emDim   <- 1
emLag   <- 1
emRad   <- 0
theiler <- 0 # Do not include the diagonal
```

## Continuous data 

We'll use the examples used in the manual of the [PyRQA](https://pypi.org/project/PyRQA/) library for Python. This is convenient, the parameters `emDim`, `emLag` and `emRad` are already given (see [the CSA book](https://complexity-methods.github.io/book/lvSystem.html) for examples on how to estimate them with `casnet`) and it allows for a comparison of the output.

```{r}
# PyRQA example data
data_points <- as.numeric(c(0.1, 0.5, 1.3, 0.7, 0.8, 1.4, 1.6, 1.2, 0.4, 1.1, 0.8, 0.2, 1.3))

plot(ts(data_points), type = "b")
```

First, we create a distance matrix based on the (delay embedded) time series and decide on a threshold criterion to turn it into a recurrence matrix of `0`s and `1`s. We already have a radius given in the PyRQA example, using a convenient graphical tool for visual inspection of the relationship between different thresholds values and the resulting recurrence rate (`RR`), we can check what this radius will yield. 

```{r}
library(casnet)

emDim   <- 2
emLag   <- 2
emRad   <- 0.65

RM <- rp(y1 = data_points, emDim = emDim, emLag = emLag)
rp_plot(RM, plotDimensions = TRUE, drawGrid = TRUE)
```

The code below applies the threshold `emRad` to the distance matrix, which generates a sparse matrix (class `dgcMatrix`, see package [Matrix]). 

```{r}
(RM <- rp(y1 = data_points, emDim = emDim, emLag = emLag, emRad = emRad))
```

The relevant analysis parameters, including the embedded series, are stored as attributes of the matrix object.

```{r}
attributes(RM)
```

It is custom to represent the recurrence matrix as a plot with coordinate `(1,1)` in the left lower corner. 

```{r}
rp_plot(RM, plotDimensions = TRUE, drawGrid = TRUE)
```

Because this analysis concerns Auto-RQA, the diagonal is usually excluded from the calculations of RQA measures. This can be achieved by setting the `theiler` parameter to `1`. This is in fact the default behavior in `casnet` if the `theiler` argument is `NA` and the recurrence matrix is detected to be symmetrical.  

```{r}
# Current value of theiler
attributes(RM)$theiler
# Values on the diagonal
Matrix::diag(RM)

# To explicitly include the diagonal in calculations set theiler to 0
(RM <- rp(y1 = data_points, emDim = emDim, emLag = emLag, emRad = emRad, theiler = 0))
attributes(RM)$theiler
```

In `casnet` the `theiler` correction will affect *all* calculations. This is different from, for example, PyRQA where it only affects the recurrence rate and measures based on diagonal line structures. Below are the results reported in the online [PyRQA manual](https://pypi.org/project/PyRQA/#usage), with the diagonal included:

```

The same for `casnet`:

```{r}
# Including diagonal
RM <- rp(y1 = data_points, emDim = emDim, emLag = emLag, emRad = emRad, theiler = 0)
out_rqa <- rp_measures(RM, silent = FALSE)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Exclude diagonal
RM2 <- rp(y1 = data_points, emDim = emDim, emLag = emLag, emRad = emRad, theiler = 1)
out_rqa2 <- rp_measures(RM2, silent = TRUE)

compOUT <- data.frame(Quantity = c("RR","DET", "MAX_dl", "MEAN_dl", "ENT_dl", "LAM", "MAX_vl", "MEAN_vl", "ENT_vl"), 
                      casnet = round(c(out_rqa$RR, out_rqa$DET, out_rqa$MAX_dl, out_rqa$MEAN_dl, out_rqa$ENT_dl, out_rqa$LAM_vl, out_rqa$MAX_vl, out_rqa$TT_vl, out_rqa$ENT_vl), digits = 6),
                      casnet = round(c(out_rqa2$RR, out_rqa2$DET, out_rqa2$MAX_dl, out_rqa2$MEAN_dl, out_rqa2$ENT_dl, out_rqa2$LAM_vl, out_rqa2$MAX_vl, out_rqa2$TT_vl, out_rqa2$ENT_vl), digits = 6),
                      PyRQA = c(0.371901, 0.411765, 3, 2.333333, 0.636514, 0.400000, 4, 2.571429, 0.955700),
                      PyRQA = c("Yes","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes"))

```


Below is a comparison of the output from `casnet::rp()` and `PyRQA`. Note that `PyRQA` includes the main diagonal for `RR` and measures based on vertical (and horizontal) lines.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(compOUT, align = c("l","c","c","c","c"), col.names = NULL) %>%
 kableExtra::add_header_above(c("\nMeasure","rp\n(theiler = 0)","rp\n(theiler = 1)", "PyRQA\n(theiler_corrector = 1)", "PyRQA\nDiagonal included?"))
```


# RQA based on massively parallel processing: `rqa_par()`


`PyRQA` was developed to perform RQA on very long time series, without overloading memory and inflating the computing time to a degree that is unmanageable in a regular workflow. It is not recommended to use matrix based functions like `casnet::rp_measures()` on time series larger than `5,000` data points, instead, `casnet::rqa_par()` can be used, which implements some of the methods used in `PyRQA`. Specifically, the memory management by limiting the precision (package [float]) and using bit compression (package [float]), as well as by computing RQA measures in a massively parallel way (package [parallel]). Compared to `casnet::rqa_par()`,`PyRQA` is still faster, but this difference becomes noticeable for very large time series (`>100,000`). 

```{r}
noise <- casnet::noise_powerlaw(N=10000, seed = 1234)
plot(ts(noise),type = "l")

#est_radius_rqa(ts_embed(noise, emDim = emDim, emLag = emLag), noise, AUTO = TRUE)
```



```

# An R interface to Marwan's commandline recurrence plots {#marwan}

> **IMPORTANT**: Currently `rp_cl` can only run on an operating system that allows execution of 32-bit applications!

The `crqa_cl()` function is a wrapper for the [commandline Recurrence Plots](http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php) executable provided by Norbert Marwan. 

The `rp` executable file is installed on your machine when the function `rp_cl()` is called for the first time:

* It is renamed to `rp` from a platform specific file downloaded from the [commandline Recurrence Plots](http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php) site.
* The file is copied to the directory: `normalizePath("[path to casnet]/exec/",mustWork = FALSE)`
   - Make sure that you have rights to execute programs in this directory!
* The latter location is stored as an option and can be read by calling `getOption("casnet.path_to_rp")`

If you cannot change the permissions on the folder where `rp` was downloaded, consider downloading the appropriate executable from the [commandline Recurrence Plots](http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php) site to a directory in which you have such permissions. Then change the `path_to_rp` option using `options(casnet.path_to_rp="YOUR_PATH_TO_RP")`. See the manual entry for `rp_cl()` for more details.

# Computational load: The Python solution [PyRQA]

When the time series you analyze are very long, the recurrence matrix will become very large and R will become very slow. One solution is to use R to run the Python program [`PyRQA`](https://pypi.org/project/PyRQA/) or perhaps [`pyunicorn`](https://github.com/pik-copan/pyunicorn). The options for `PyRQA` are limited compared to the casnet functions, but the gain in processing speed is remarkable!

What follows is an example of how you could make `PyRQA` run in R using the package `reticulate`.

### Setup the environment {-}

Suppose you are on a machine that has both `R` and `Python` installed then the steps are:

* Make sure `Python` and `pip` are up to date
* Create a virtual (or a coda) environment. 
* Install `PyRQA` into the virtual environment. 

You should only have to create and setup the environment once.

```{r pyrqa, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(reticulate)

# OS requirements
# Python3.X is installed and updated.
# On MacOS you'll probably need to run these commands in a Terminal window:
python3 pip install --update pip # Updates the Python module installer
python3 pip intall pyrqa # Installs the pyrqa module on your machine

# First make sure you use the latest Python version
# You can check your machine by calling: reticulate::py_discover_config()
reticulate::use_python("/usr/local/bin/python3")

# Create a new environment "r-reticulate", the path is stored in vEnv
# On Windows use coda_create() see the reticulate manual.
vEnv <- reticulate::virtualenv_create("r-reticulate")

# Install pyrqa into the virtual environment
reticulate::virtualenv_install("r-reticulate","pyrqa")

# If you wish to remove the environment use: reticulate::virtualenv_remove("r-reticulate")
```


After the environment is set up:

* Restart your R session and instruct the system to use Python in the virtual environment.
* Import `PyRQA` into your `R` session.
* Use the `PyRQA` functions that are now available as fields (`$`) of the imported object!

An important thing to note in the example below is the use of `as.integer()` to pass integer variables to Python.

```{r pyrqa2, eval = FALSE}
# Make sure you associate reticulate with your virtual environment.
reticulate::use_virtualenv("r-reticulate", required = TRUE)

# Import pyrqa into your R session
pyrqa <- reticulate::import("pyrqa")

# Alternatively, you can import from a path in the virtual environment.
# On MacOS this will be a hidden folder in your home directory:
# '.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/lib/Python3.X/site-packages'
# pyrqa <- import_from_path(file.path(vEnv,"/lib/python3.9/site-packages"))

# Now perform RQA on your N = 10,000 time series!
Y <- cumsum(rnorm(10000))

# Automated parameter search will still take some time using casnet
system.time({
  emPar <- casnet::est_parameters(Y, doPlot = FALSE)
  emRad <- casnet::est_radius(y1 = Y, emLag = emPar$optimLag, emDim = emPar$optimDim)
  })
# user    system  elapsed 
# 299.732 89.094  393.620 

# About 5 minutes to find a delay, embedding dimension and radius yielding 5% recurrent points.

# Now do an RQA on the 10,000 x 10,000 matrix using Python
system.time({
time_series <- pyrqa$time_series$TimeSeries(Y, 
                                            embedding_dimension= as.integer(emPar$optimDim), 
                                            time_delay= as.integer(emPar$optimLag))
settings    <- pyrqa$settings$Settings(time_series, 
                                       analysis_type = pyrqa$analysis_type$Classic,
                                       neighbourhood = pyrqa$neighbourhood$FixedRadius(emRad$Radius),
                                       similarity_measure = pyrqa$metric$EuclideanMetric,
                                       theiler_corrector = 0)
computation <- pyrqa$computation$RQAComputation$create(settings)
result      <- computation$run()
})
# user   system  elapsed 
# 2.996  0.069   0.365 

# About 3 seconds for the analysis...
# That's really fast!

print(result)
```
      
```

# Other options: Julia 

The Julia software has a number of very powerful packages to simulate and analyze dynamical systems, see: https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/latest/

You can perform RQA (https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/latest/tutorial/#State-space-sets), but perhaps more interestingly, you can use a powerful automatic parameter selection algorithm for embedding called PECUZAL: https://juliadynamics.github.io/DelayEmbeddings.jl/stable/unified/  

I use the freely available software *Visual Studio Code* to write and run Python (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) and Julia (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia)
