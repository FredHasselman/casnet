This vignette discusses how to conduct a large variety of recurrence-based time series analyses using R-package *casnet*. It is not the only `R` package that can run recurrence analyses, the closest alternative to `casnet` is probably package [`crqa`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crqa/index.html). It has a great tutorial paper by [@coco2014]). Several other packages have dedicated functions, e.g. package `nonlinearTseries` has a function `RQA`. There are also many options outside of the `R` framework, see the [Recurrence Plot webpage](http://www.recurrence-plot.tk/programmes.php) for a comprehensive list of software.

There are 2 main ways to run Recurrence Quantification Analyses in `casnet`:

* Using functions `rp`, `rp_measures` and `rp_plot`
* Using function `rp_cl` which will run Norbert Marwan's [commandline Recurrence Plots](http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php)

The following examples will use the native `casnet` functions, see the paragraph [An R interface to Marwan's commandline recurrence plots](#marwan) to learn about using `rp_cl()`.

The first part of this vignette will demonstrate the basics of recurrence quantification using unordered categorical data. The second part will discuss RQA for [continuous data](#lvSystem). This will be a bit more formal with respect to defining the recurrence matrix and how to calculate the various RQA measures.


Please see the chapters on RQA the Complex Systems Approach book for more details: 

[RQA on unordered categorical data](https://complexity-methods.github.io/book/auto-rqa-categorical-data.html)

[RQA on continuous data](https://complexity-methods.github.io/book/auto-rqa-continuous-data.html)


# An R interface to Marwan's commandline recurrence plots {#marwan}

> **IMPORTANT**: Currently `rp_cl` can only run on an operating system that allows execution of 32-bit applications!

The `rp_cl()` function is a wrapper for the [commandline Recurrence Plots](http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php) executable provided by Norbert Marwan. 

The `rp` executable is installed on your machine when the function `rp_cl()` is called for the first time:

* It is renamed to `rp` from a platform specific file downloaded from the [commandline Recurrence Plots](http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php) site.
* The file is copied to the directory: `r normalizePath("[path to casnet]/exec/",mustWork = FALSE)`
   - Make sure that you have rights to execute programs in this directory!
* The latter location is stored as an option and can be read by calling `getOption("casnet.path_to_rp")`

If you cannot change the permissions on the folder where `rp` was downloaded, consider downloading the appropriate executable from the [commandline Recurrence Plots](http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php) site to a directory in which you have such permissions. Then change the `path_to_rp` option using `options(casnet.path_to_rp="YOUR_PATH_TO_RP")`. See the manual entry for `rp_cl()` for more details.

# Computational load: The Python solution [PyRQA]

When the time series you analyze are very long, the recurrence matrix will become very large and R will become very slow. One solution is to use R to run the Python program [`PyRQA`](https://pypi.org/project/PyRQA/) or perhaps [`pyunicorn`](https://github.com/pik-copan/pyunicorn). The options for `PyRQA` are limited compared to the casnet functions, but the gain in processing speed is remarkable!

What follows is an example of how you could make `PyRQA` run in R using the package `reticulate`.

### Setup the environment {-}

Suppose you are on a machine that has both `R` and `Python` installed then the steps are:

* Make sure `Python` and `pip` are up to date
* Create a virtual (or a coda) environment. 
* Install `PyRQA` into the virtual environment. 

You should only have to create and setup the environment once.

```{r pyrqa, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(reticulate)

# OS requirements
# Python3.X is installed and updated.
# On MacOS you'll probably need to run these commands in a Terminal window:
python3 pip install --update pip # Updates the Python module installer
python3 pip intall pyrqa # Installs the pyrqa module on your machine

# First make sure you use the latest Python version
# You can check your machine by calling: reticulate::py_discover_config()
reticulate::use_python("/usr/local/bin/python3")

# Create a new environment "r-reticulate", the path is stored in vEnv
# On Windows use coda_create() see the reticulate manual.
vEnv <- reticulate::virtualenv_create("r-reticulate")

# Install pyrqa into the virtual environment
reticulate::virtualenv_install("r-reticulate","pyrqa")

# If you wish to remove the environment use: reticulate::virtualenv_remove("r-reticulate")
```


After the environment is set up:

* Restart your R session and instruct the system to use Python in the virtual environment.
* Import `PyRQA` into your `R` session.
* Use the `PyRQA` functions that are now available as fields (`$`) of the imported object!

An important thing to note in the example below is the use of `as.integer()` to pass integer variables to Python.

```{r pyrqa2, eval = FALSE}
# Make sure you associate reticulate with your virtual environment.
reticulate::use_virtualenv("r-reticulate", required = TRUE)

# Import pyrqa into your R session
pyrqa <- reticulate::import("pyrqa")

# Alternatively, you can import from a path in the virtual environment.
# On MacOS this will be a hidden folder in your home directory:
# '.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/lib/Python3.X/site-packages'
# pyrqa <- import_from_path(file.path(vEnv,"/lib/python3.9/site-packages"))

# Now perform RQA on your N = 10,000 time series!
Y <- cumsum(rnorm(10000))

# Automated parameter search will still take some time using casnet
system.time({
  emPar <- casnet::est_parameters(Y, doPlot = FALSE)
  emRad <- casnet::est_radius(y1 = Y, emLag = emPar$optimLag, emDim = emPar$optimDim)
  })
# user    system  elapsed 
# 299.732 89.094  393.620 

# About 5 minutes to find a delay, embedding dimension and radius yielding 5% recurrent points.

# Now do an RQA on the 10,000 x 10,000 matrix using Python
system.time({
time_series <- pyrqa$time_series$TimeSeries(Y, 
                                            embedding_dimension= as.integer(emPar$optimDim), 
                                            time_delay= as.integer(emPar$optimLag))
settings    <- pyrqa$settings$Settings(time_series, 
                                       analysis_type = pyrqa$analysis_type$Classic,
                                       neighbourhood = pyrqa$neighbourhood$FixedRadius(emRad$Radius),
                                       similarity_measure = pyrqa$metric$EuclideanMetric,
                                       theiler_corrector = 0)
computation <- pyrqa$computation$RQAComputation$create(settings)
result      <- computation$run()
})
# user   system  elapsed 
# 2.996  0.069   0.365 

# About 3 seconds for the analysis...
# That's really fast!

print(result)
```
      
```
