}
\value{
A list object containing 1-3 elements, depending on arguments requesting output.

\enumerate{
\item \code{rqa_measures} - A list of the (C)RQA measures returned if \code{returnMeasures = TRUE}:
\itemize{
 \item RR = 'Recurrence rate'
 \item DET = 'Determinism'
 \item DET_RR = 'Ratio DET/RR'
 \item LAM = 'Laminarity'
 \item LAM_DET = 'Ratio LAM/DET'
 \item L_max = 'maximal diagonal line length'
 \item L_mean = 'mean diagonal line length'
 \item L_entr = 'Entropy of diagonal line length distribution'
 \item DIV =  'Divergence (1/L_max)'
 \item V_max = 'maximal vertical line length'
 \item TT = 'Trapping time'
 \item V_entr = 'Entropy of vertical line length distribution'
 \item T1 = 'Recurrence times 1st type'

 \item W_mean = 'Mean interval'
 \item W_entr = 'Entropy intervals'
 \item W_prob = 'Prob interval'
 \item F_min = 'F min'
}
\item \code{rqa_rpvector} - The radius thresholded distance matrix (recurrence matrix), which can be visualised as a recurrence plot by calling \code{\link{recmat_plot}}. If a sliding window analysis is conducted this will be a list of matrices and could potentially grow too large to handle. It is recommended you save the output to disk by setting \code{saveOut = TRUE}.
\item \code{rqa_diagdist} - The distribution of diagonal line lengths
}
}
\description{
This function will run the \href{http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php}{commandline Recurrence Plots} executable provided by Norbert Marwan.
}
\details{
The \code{rp} executable is installed when the package is loaded for the first time and is renamed to \code{rp}, from a platform specific filename located in the directory: \code{...\\casnet\\commandline_rp\\}.
The file is copied to the directory: \code{...\\casnet\\exec\\}
The latter location is stored as an option and can be read by calling \code{getOption("casnet.path_to_rp")}.

\section{Troubleshooting}{

Some notes on resolving errors with \code{rp}.

\itemize{
 \item \emph{Copy failed} - Every time the package is loaded it will check whether a log file \code{rp_instal_log.txt} is present in the \code{...\\casnet\\exec\\} directory. If you detach the package and delete the log file, another copy of the executable will be attempted.
\item \emph{Copy still fails and/or no permission to copy} - You can copy the approrpiate executable to any directory you have access to, be sure to rename it to \code{rp} (\code{rp.exe} on Windows OS). Then, either pass the path to \code{rp} as an argument (\code{path_to_rp}) in the \code{fast_crqa} function call, or, as a more permanent solution, set the \code{path_to_rp} option by calling \code{options(casnet.path_to_rp="YOUR_PATH")}. If you cannot acces the directory \code{...\\casnet\\commandline_rp\\}, download the appropriate executable from the \href{http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php}{commandline Recurrence Plots} page
\item \emph{Error in execution of \code{rp}} - This can have a variety of causes, the \code{rp} executable is called using \code{\link[devtools]{RCMD}} and makes use of the \code{\link{normalizePath}} function with argument \code{mustWork = FALSE}. Problems caused by specific OS, machine, or, locale problems (e.g. the \code{winslash} can be reported as an \href{https://github.com/FredHasselman/casnet/issues}{issue on Github}). One execution error that occurs when the OS is not recognised properly can be resolved by chekcing \code{getOption("casnet.rp_prefix")}. On Windows OS this should return \code{"/"}, on Linux or macOS it should return \code{"./"}. You can manually set the correct prefix by calling \code{options(casnet.rp_prefix="CORRECT OS PREFIX")}
