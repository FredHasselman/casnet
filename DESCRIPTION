Description: A collection of analytic tools for studying signals recorded from complex adaptive systems or networks:
    - Recurrence Quantification Analyses (CrossRQA, Categorical RQA, Chromatic RQA, Anisotropic RQA).
    - Fluctuation Analyses (DFA varieties, PSD slope, SDA, Multifractal DFA, Wavelet Singularity Spectrum).
    - Coupling Analyses (Cross Conformal Mapping, Detection of Coupling Direction, CRQA).
    - Network based time series analyses (Recurrence Networks, Multifractal Spectrum Networks, Multiplex Networks).
